# JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ More Exercises

ðŸ“š This repository contains **additional solved tasks** from the _"More Exercises"_ sections of the **JavaScript Fundamentals** course by **SoftUni**.

These are problems I originally skipped during my first pass through the course. They're now part of my effort to **revisit, practice, and deepen** my understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

## âœ… Purpose

To improve fluency in JavaScript by solving extra tasks that go beyond the standard exercises â€” covering all types of topics introduced in the fundamentals phase.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

- Each topic or section has its own folder.
- Each file contains a single solved task with meaningful naming.

---

ðŸ›  This repo complements my main [JavaScript Fundamentals Repository](https://github.com/vasilenaph/Programming-Fundamentals-with-Javascript), which includes the core exercises from the course.
